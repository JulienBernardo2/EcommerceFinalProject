 For our project, we are aiming to create a web marketplace application which will resemble Ebay. Clients will be able to sell their own products and
 also buy products for sale.

## Platform of choice
 Our project will be using Xampp to run the website and phpmyadmin for our database, here are the following steps on how to run the project
 
   1. Download Xampp and install it
   2. Clone or download our repo as a zip file
   3. Extract the files to the location on your computer "/xampp/htdocs"
   4. Once this is finished, run xampp and turn on Apache and Phpmyadmin
   5. Then click the Admin button for Phpmyadmin
   6. Click the import button and select the database named "jkn_bay.sql" from the zip file
   7. Now open up a browser and type "localhost"
   8. The JKN Bay marketplace should appear
